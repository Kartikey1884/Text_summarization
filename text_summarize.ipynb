I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \\ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being taken by different agencies'),\n",

      "\n",
      "In his farewell speech, A P J Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude and reflects on his 5-year tenure as President. He highlights 10 key messages, including accelerating development, empowering villages, and youth movement for a developed India by 2020. He shares a memorable question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India can't become a developed nation by 2020, and reiterates his commitment to making India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, assured the person that their dream would be taken seriously, and committed to taking it to the nation's highest institution to work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth and villages to achieve a prosperous and developed nation. The speaker shares personal experiences, including a visit to a village in Nagaland, and highlights initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College's PURA complex, which provides urban amenities to rural areas, generating employment and entrepreneurship. The goal is to transform India's 600,000 villages and create a better future for the nation's 540 million youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights a successful model of rural development, where 1000 self-help groups and technological support have enabled villagers to cultivate waste land, generate power, and create entrepreneurs. A collaboration with Japanese experts has also led to the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products, showcasing a sustainable economic development model that can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares their enriching experience of meeting 6000 farmers and interacting with agricultural scientists. They emphasize the need to double agricultural production, improve economic conditions, and empower farmers for a second green revolution. The speaker expresses confidence in achieving 4% annual agricultural GDP growth through partnerships. They also recount a inspiring meeting with a disabled person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite his physical limitations, remains confident and happy, attributing his positive outlook to the support of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories. The first is about a physically challenged person who, despite his limitations, blossomed as a talented musician with a positive attitude and perseverance. The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who showed indomitable spirit and courage in recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005, and how they overcame their problems with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the bravery and resilience of people in the face of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis. The speaker shares personal experiences of witnessing communities come together to support each other, including children and villagers participating in relief operations and tribal islanders taking in affected victims as their own. The speech also touches on the importance of connectivity and societal transformation, citing an address to the Pan African Parliament. Overall, the speech celebrates the courage and strength of people in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries via satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks. The project aims to link 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers, with a pilot project already launched in Ethiopia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses three main topics: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's technological collaboration with Africa, providing tele-consultation services to African hospitals.\n",
      "2. The speaker's experiences with India's Defence Forces, expressing pride in their bravery and commitment to protecting the nation.\n",
      "3. The youth movement in India, particularly the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\", which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens and contribute to India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the transformation of Indian youth into enlightened citizens through initiatives like the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which trains students in self-discipline, responsibility, and leadership. With 540 million youth under 25, the speaker believes that empowering them with value-based education and leadership can be a powerful resource for the country's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while striving for economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence in the country's potential to become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. The speech concludes with a call to action, resolving to work towards a developed India with a reduced rural-urban divide, equitable access to resources, and quality education for all, making it an attractive destination for talent and investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech envisions a nation with universal access to quality healthcare, transparent governance, zero poverty, and eradication of social evils, ultimately aiming for a prosperous, secure, and happy society with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support and shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of Indians, promoting self-confidence and working towards making India a developed nation by 2020.\n",

Inspired by a question from a young girl named Anukriti, he emphasizes the need to achieve a developed India by 2020, a dream shared by over 540 million youth. He highlights three main areas: accelerating development, empowering villages by providing physical and electronic connectivity, and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's PURA complex is cited as a successful example, where 1000 self-help groups have generated large-scale employment and created entrepreneurs, developing 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land and promoting sustainable economic development. Additionally, the villagers have worked with international experts to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing their innovative ability and enabling them to produce globally acceptable products. He notes that the whole country needs 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide. His 10 key messages aim to guide the nation towards a prosperous, safe, and proud India, with the youth movement playing a crucial role in achieving this vision by 2020.\n",
